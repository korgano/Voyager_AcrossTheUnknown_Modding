Voyager - Across the Unknown is an Unreal Engine 5.6 game. The demo version is unencrypted, but the final game may be.

## What can bemodded
At this point, only `DT_Resources` under `BetterStartCap\STVoyager\Content\STVoyager\GameResources` is proven to be moddable. Other mods made with [retoc](https://github.com/trumank/retoc) build `ed328e5` do not cause crashes, but may or may not function.

## Tools required
